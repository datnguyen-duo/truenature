                        Viniyoga is a term given by T. Krisnamacharya to his son, TKV Desikachar identify an orientation to practice that is adapted to the unique interests and needs of the individual, and progresses toward a clear goal, over time. A Sanskrit word, Viniyoga translates to “appropriate application”. A wise teacher in the tradition once shared, Yoga can be a like a life raft, getting back to level in a time of trouble, in can be a catapault, launching you toward transformation and your most authentic self, once the base is stable. Viniyoga has tools for both.
